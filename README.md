# Sith Lord Finder

As any avid Star Wars fan knows, the Rule of Two is a Sith philosophy mandating that only two Sith Lords can exist at any given time: a master to embody the power of the dark side of the Force, and an apprentice to crave it.

Like dating in the real world, *finding your ideal Sith counterpart can be hard*. It's not like an easily corruptable young Jedi with pent up fear and hatred comes knocking at your door every day.

This is why I have developed the Sith Lord Finder which can be described in five simple words: **Tinder for the Dark Side**. Sith Lord Finder is a compatibility-based application that takes in results from a survey I have curated for malevolent force wielders and pairs the user with whoever gave the most similar answers.

Give it a try, and I'm sure you will find a surpise, but also a welcome one.
